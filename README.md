# 3-Tap FIR Filter

## Overview
This project implements a 3-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. FIR filters are widely used in digital signal processing (DSP) applications for filtering signals while maintaining a linear phase response.

## Features
- Implements a simple 3-tap FIR filter.
- Configurable filter coefficients.
- Supports real-time and offline processing.
- Suitable for FPGA, ASIC, or software-based implementations.

## Filter Equation
The output of the FIR filter is computed as:

\[ y[n] = h_0 \cdot x[n] + h_1 \cdot x[n-1] + h_2 \cdot x[n-2] \]

where:
- \( x[n] \) is the input signal.
- \( y[n] \) is the output signal.
- \( h_0, h_1, h_2 \) are the filter coefficients.

## Usage
### 1. Software Implementation
If using a programming language such as Python or C, implement the filter as follows:


### 2. FPGA/Hardware Implementation
For FPGA implementations, the FIR filter can be described in Verilog or VHDL using shift registers and multipliers.

### 3. Simulation
To test the FIR filter:
1. Apply a known input sequence.
2. Compare the output against expected results.
3. Verify frequency response using FFT.

## Applications
- Audio signal processing
- Communication systems
- Image processing
- Sensor signal conditioning
